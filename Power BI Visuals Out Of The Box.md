## Apply filters in Power BI reports

- Visual-level filter  
Suppose you have a bar chart, a pie chart, and a table
in your report, and you want to filter the data only in the bar chart. In
that case, youâ€™d apply a visual-level filter to that chart.
- Page-level filter  
Maybe your report has 10 pages, but you want to apply
a filter to just one of those pages. In that case you could apply a pagelevel
filter.
- Report-level filter  
To apply a filter to your entire report, you use a report-level filter.
- Drill-through filter  
This filter enables you to drill through the data in a
report much as you would data in a visual. For example, suppose your
report contains a table. You could apply the drill-through filter to that
table to analyze a piece of data in that table in depth.
